Most Curious Artifacts of Extraterrestrial Origin

Wreckage of meteorites with remains of unknown life forms, metal details from unknown alloys, spheres of obscure function, that possess unique physical properties - how to explain the appearance of all these amazing artifacts on our planet? Many scientists are inclined to a completely logical explanation and believe that such finds are of extraterrestrial origin, and they landed on the ground during the next visit of aliens. Others find such explanations frivolous and consider them as an attempt to 'hide behind the backs of the aliens' from despair. Disputes about whether representatives of extraterrestrial civilizations visited our planet have been going on for hundreds of years. Amazing finds, which are discovered in various parts of the world by the most ordinary people, are increasingly made to think that we are not alone in the universe.
